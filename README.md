# Intelligent-Log-Analysis-and-Incident-Prediction
PROBLEM STATMENT: Create a system that analyzes application and infrastructure logs to predict potential incidents before they impact users.

Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement log pattern analysis, anomaly detection, incident prediction using historical data
Critical Thinking: Identify meaningful log patterns, understand system behavior, balance alert fatigue vs incident prevention
Problem Solving: Handle massive log volumes, diverse log formats, real-time processing requirements
Modular Structure: Separate log ingestion, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and alerting modules
Clear Architecture: Flow from log streams → pattern analysis → anomaly detection → incident prediction → alerts
Deliverable: Log analysis system that predicts incidents and provides early warning alerts with context.
